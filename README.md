## Getting started

- Run `bundle install` to get the dependecies
- Run `rails s` to start  the server
- Open `https://localhost:3000` in your browser
- to run test `bundle exec rspec`

## Tests
Diffult (run all spec files):

`bundle exec rspec`

Run all spec files in the `Spec` folder:

`bundle exec rspec spec`

Run all spec files in a single directory:

`bundle exec rspec spec/models`

Run a single spec file:

`bundle exec rspec spec/views/login_page_spec.rb`

Run a single example from a spec file(by line number):

`bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb:8`

See all options for running specs:

`bundle exec rspec --help`
